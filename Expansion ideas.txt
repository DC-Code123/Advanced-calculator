Here are several ideas to expand your Advanced Calculator project:

1.Scientific Functions:
    -Add support for trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.),     logarithms, square roots, and factorials.
    -Allow users to enter expressions like sin(30) + log(10).

2.Graphing Capabilities:
    -Integrate a simple plotting feature to graph mathematical functions (e.g., plot y = x^2).
    -Output graph data to a file or use a library for visualization.

3.User Accounts and Profiles:
    -Allow multiple users with separate calculation histories.
    -Add login/logout functionality.

4.History Search and Filtering:
    -Implement search/filter options for calculation history (e.g., show only division operations, or results above a certain value).

5.Import/Export History:
    -Allow users to export their calculation history to CSV or import from a file.

6.Unit Conversion:
    -Add a module for converting between units (length, weight, temperature, etc.).

7.Memory Functions:
    -Implement calculator memory (M+, M-, MR, MC) to store and recall values.

8.Error Handling and Suggestions:
    -Provide more detailed error messages and suggestions for correcting invalid expressions.

9.Command-Line Arguments:
    -Allow calculations to be performed via command-line arguments for scripting or automation.

10.GUI Interface:
    -Build a graphical user interface using a library like Qt or wxWidgets for a more user-friendly experience.

11.Support for Variables:
    -Allow users to define and use variables in expressions (e.g., a = 5, then a * 2).

12.Programming Mode:
    -Add support for programming-related calculations (binary, hex, bitwise operations).

13.Session Autosave/Recovery:
    -Automatically save session state and recover after a crash or restart.

14.Localization/Internationalization:
    -Support multiple languages for the user interface and messages.

15.Extensible Plugin System:
    -Allow users to add custom functions or modules via plugins.
